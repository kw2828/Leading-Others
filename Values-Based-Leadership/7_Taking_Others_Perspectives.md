# Taking Others' Perspectives

Another approach to values-based decision making, aside from weighing consequences, is to consider the perspectives of others. 
This requires considering not just the perspectives of those at the top, but also those throughout an organization.

### Goals:
- Learn about the difference between consequentialist and non-consequentialist arguments
- Explore Kant's concepts of rights and duty as they related to moral decision making
- Explore Rawl's theory of justice as it relatese to values-based leadrship
- Practice linking specific company policies and values-based decision making.

## Philosophies of Perspective-Taking
- We will discuss two philosophical approaches on perspective taking.
- 1. Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative
  - a philosophy grounded in the idea that we, as rational human beings, have a duty to give other rational beings a certain form of respect
- 2. John Rawl's Veil of Ignorance
  - focuses on the ideae that we should consider other people's perspectives when designing social institutions and company policies.
- Seeing things from other people's perspective is a crucially important skill for effective organizational leadership. 
  - Perspective taking is not just a useful skill
  - Important analytical lens for grounding our values, goals, and practices as leaders
  - Many cultural and religious traditions express values or norms of behavior in ways that emphasize the importance of perspective taking
  - Examples from many cultural/religions
    - "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful." - Udana-Varga (Buddhism)
    - "Do to others what you would have them do to you." - Christianity
    - "What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others" - Confucianism
    - "This is the sum of duty: do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you." - Hinduism
    - "Do unto all men as you would wish to have done unto you." - Abu Dawud
  - Meanings and interpretations vary across cultural and religious traditions
  - Share common notion to consider things rom the perspective of others
- Two philosophical notions of perspective taking

### Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative
- Kant's philosophy is anchored in the idea that we, as rational human beings, have a duty to give other rational beings a certain form of respect.
- Kant formulated this idea in his categorical imperative for moral behavior
- "Never treat someone merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end."
- Example. 
  -coercion
    - Wage Theft
    - Immigrant Laborers 
      - Threatened overtime without pay 
      - Threats of retaliation 
  - Deception
    - Seriously defective and essentially useless (wouldn't buy the product if known it was defective)
    - Deceive her that it is defective
      - using as her as means (to make money)
- In contrast, if sell product that works as intended
  - Treating her both as a means to make money for myself
  - And as an end, in the sense that she can make use of the product
- Treating someone as an end implictly involves taking their perspectives and recognizing their legitimate goals and intentions

### John Rawl's Veil of Ignorance
- Other's perspectives in social institutions and company
- Privilege (Educated parents, opportunities to succeed, develop valued skills)
- Upbringing Low Income (Faced Discrimination, Limited Resources) 
- Fortunate/Unfortunate
- Assume we don't know our own circumstances (who I'd be) 
- Fair and just institutions
- Rawl's
  - Equality of Opportunity (encompasses that society is setup in a way that people can be succssful)
  - Risk averse of least well off people (extreme distribution worse off)
  - Same salaries (quickly go out of businss)
  - Operate effective (failing economy) -> differences of outcome is okay
  - Differences, maximizing not welll-off
  - Veil of ignorance (try to see things others, staff members)
- Employees
  - Janitor (decent pay, opportunities for success)
  - Contractors (low pay, no promotions)
  - Put position as janitor
- Strong mission and values
  - Policies
  - Perspective taking
