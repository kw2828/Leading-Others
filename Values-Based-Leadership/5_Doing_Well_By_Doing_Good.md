# Doing well by doing good

Goals:
- Learn about competing persepctives about the role and responsibility of firms in society
- Distinguish between morally motivated and strategic CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)

How should organizations and their leaders think about their ethical obligations to society and the environment? 
Obligations are referred to as CSR. Those pursuing socially responsible initiatives need to consider the interests of multiple stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, and communities)

### CSR

Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, refers to the need for businesses to be good corporate citizens who are accountable to stakeholders beyond shareholders and investors. Adopting humane labor practices, reducing one's carbon footprint, contributing to social welfare, and engaging in philanthropic endeavors are examples of CSR and can be motivated by a moral position or by market incentives.

What do you believe are an organization's social obligations? Do you know your organization's stance on this question? What are some implications of that stance?

Two competing views
- Friedman - Managers need to maximize profit (manager), Strategic CSR. Ethical custom (who determines?) socially consciousu
- Porter - Shared Value too much emphasis (Build local institutions) - similar, no tradeoffs between profitability/social responsbility
- Chipotle (Ethical supply chain) Prescriptive ethics
