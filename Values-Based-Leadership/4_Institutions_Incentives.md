# Institutions and Incentives

Focus on prescriptive ethics (or how people should engage in values-based leadership). 
Derived from ethical theories and decision making frameworks, prescriptive ethics offers ways of reasoning about ethical choices.

Many business situations are ethical situations, because they involve actions with impacts on multiple stakeholders. Although some situations are win-win or win-win-win, many other situations invovlve tradeoffs. Individuals like you are responsible for handling these tradeoffs. 
In these situations, we want you to see that there are well-reasoned decisions and poorly-reasoned decisions. To make well-reasoned decisions, you'll need to explore your own moral principles, seek to understand the diversity of perspectives and take stock of implications and tradeoffs.

### Goals of this module
- Understand the societal instituions structure incentives and determine whether profit maximization leads to good outcomes for society in general
- Analyze tradeoffs between stakeholders

### Transition from Descriptive to Prescriptive Ethics
- Descriptive Ethics ("How do people make choices?")
- Prescriptive Ethics ("How should I make ethical choices")
- Shifting gears, talking about descriptive ethics (how people make decisions)
- Common theme has been that people's values are often compromised by various psychological biases
- Important to realize, not only so we can recognize these biases in ourselves, and mitigate them, but also so we can design and lead organizations that address and root out these biases
- Descriptive Ethics is a precursor to Prescriptive Ethics so we can apply our values in the real world
- What motivates stakeholders?
  - Reasonable people can disagree and hold different set of values
  - They can disagree on the underlying criteria that are used to make decisions
  - as well as what should be done in business settings
- Example
  - Some people may believe that the rightness or wrongness of an action is judged by its consequences on stakeholders, and managing these tradeoffs is an improtant responsibility of leaders.
  - Others might believe that the ends cannot justify the means, and that instead perspective taking is the most important value
- Aware of the diversity of perspectives + Pushing on your own beliefs = better managers
- Disagree with people based on your core values (key is how to constructively disagree)
  - Facts and analysis, others are about values
  - Seperating out these disagreements is important to building compromises, resolving disputes, leading teams, and persuading others

### Social Institutions, Profit Maximization, and Effects on Society
- Adam Smith famously argued that people's pursuit of their own self-interest can lead to good outcomes for society
- "Every individual neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it...he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hhand to promote an end which was part of his intention." - Adam Smith
- Invisible hand (one of the most powerful ideas in the social sciences)
  - Invisible hand explains why capitalist economies can do an amazing job of providing a vast array of goods and services
  - while consistently producing innovations that are incredibly valuable for society
  - Serious limitations, companies pursue narrow profits often have serious effects in society (e.g. advertisements, pollution,)
  - So self-interest to profit maximization can be a powerful force for societal good, devasating effects
  - Societal Institutions
    - product liabillity (manufacturers need to pay consumers)
    - Liability System and Product Safety 
    - Liability rules well designed, economic incentives (profit aligned) products dangerous, court verdicts lose money
    - Absence of liability rules
    - Invisible hands on dangerous product works on Societal Institutions
  - Taxation of pollution
    - Pay taxes on how much they pollute
    - Align profits and societal well-being
    - They can, not automatic, set too low (not enough incentive). Companies incentivize to shut down
  - Implications on practice of business
    - Well-functioning and legal 
    - Pursuit of profit, positive effects of society as a whole
    - Enforcement is ineffective
    - Business assess tradeoffs, effects on others in society
    - Well-functioning
    - Fail to align profit maximizing incentives
    - Many banks are too big to fail
  - Incentive
    - Excessively risky investments
    - too big to fail
- Operation of invisible hand (self-interest with societal impact)
  - Societal Institutions
  - Well designed liability systems can lead to good consequences (profit maximization and societal impact)
  - Absent or poorly design can be negativee
