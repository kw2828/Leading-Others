# Summary

Take stock in what we learned. At a big picture level, there are many ways that we can incorporate our values into our decisions as leaders. 

1. We can go with our gut instincts (System 1) vs (System 2)
    - Appealing in several ways
    - It is fast and easy
    - Feels very authentic in the moment
    - Problem: our gut instinct may be misguided and erroneous
    - May not be a genuinee reflection of our deeply-held values
2. We can follow cues from the actions or values of those around us
    - Natural approach, after we humans are social animals
    - Problems: misperceive others' actions or values (Misperception of Norms)
    - Worse: by conforming to what others are doing, we may find ourselves doing things way out of line with our values
3. Consequentialism
    - Analyze the consequences of our actions and how they will affect the well-being of different people within/outsidee of our companies
    - Doing this enables us to address issues of tradeoffs (costs/benefits)
    - Crucially important -> not every decision in business or in life is a win-win-win situation for all parties involved
    - Challenge: come up with an accurate asssessment of the effects of our actions.
    - We humans have a natural tendency to suddenely put a thumb on the scales in favor of whatever action we personally feel like taking
4. Engage in perspctive taking
    - Asking yourself: "Am I respecting this person as an autonomous, rational decision maker, or am I just using them for my own objectives?"
    - Veil of ignorance: "How would it feel if I were in the shoes of other people affected by this decision?"
    - Powerful question, strong sense of empathy for others
    - However, questions don't always lead to clear answers about the right course of action that we should take.
  
Beyond these four approaches, a major takeaway is if we wish to make values-based decisions, wee can't just focus narrowly on ourselves:
- to be a leader, someone that people choose to follow, it is essential to lead with our values
- now in some sense that point is obvious:
    - Nobody looks at a CEO and says that they're a great leader because of their incredible ability to be selfish
    - Nobody respects powerful people who are just in it for themselves
- Tricky thing: we're prone to be selfish
    - Self-serving bias
    - In-group bias (small group of people we identify with)
- Worse thing: humans are great at rationalizing away this behavior, coming up with stories to tell others, and even to ourselves about why we're actually great people
- The question then, "how to avoid falling prey to these tendencies?"
    - 1. Don't try to do it alone, but structure your organization to promote good decision making by:
        - Explain your values, and your company's values, to the people around you. 
        - Listen to and respect their values
        - Create the formal structures and informal norms that enable and encourage everyonee in your company to live by their values.
        - Make sure they can hold you, as a leader, accountable for living by your values
    - 2. Anticipate and plan for difficult situations
        - Ex. Going into a meeting where you are likely to be pressured to do something that is out of step with your values
        - Prepare a plan for how to react when this request is madee
    - 3. Be careful about the situations that you put yourself into in the first place
        - Great to bee a heroic individual, living our values no matter thee circumstances
        - Realistic to put ourselves in circumstances, jobs, and relationships that reinforce our values rather than undermine them
    - 4. Plan your life to cultivate the virtues to which you aspire
        - To make those values we need to make it emotionally compelling for us
        - Can't give one answer (literature, religion, cultural, stories) 
  
The first covered psychological factors that make it difficult for people to adhere to their values. 
The second part covered principles that can provide a basis for values-based leadership.
