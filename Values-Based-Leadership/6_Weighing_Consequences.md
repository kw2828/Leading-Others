# Weighing Consequences 

One common way we try to engage in values-based leaedership is to assess how an action affects our stakeholders - customers, employees, shareholders, and society at large. We try to make business decisions that maximize benefits and minimize harm.
A consequentialist analysis like this is very complex and, while many companies do not take the time to complete a rigorous consequentialist analysis, many use consequentialist arguments to justify their decisions. We will explore the strengths and weaknesses of the consequentialist framwork.

Goals:
- Learn about consequentialist reasoning and managing tradeoffs
- Realize that we often talk like conseqeuntialists
- Know weaknesses of consequentialism
- Use the stakeholder analysis framework
- Identify what consequences need to be researched


## Consequentialism

Consequentialism involves assessing how an action affects various stakeholders and then weighing the benefits and harms on those stakholders, before choosing an action. We will discuss in detail how to conduct such an analysis, objections to this approach toward decision making, and ways this approach may be applied in concrete business decisions.

### An Overview of consequentialism
- One common way we engage in values-based leadership, is that we weigh the consequences of our actions - called consequentialism. We try to make business decisions that maximizes benefits and minimize hard for all our stakeholders, employees.
- Cars (Cannot be created to be entirely safe)
  - Safety Features (Too Many) $$$ Priced out
  - Safety Features (Few) 
  - Delicate cost/benefit analysis (seems obvious on surface level)
- 1. Understand status quo and alternatives
  - Status quo (No paid parental leave) 
  - Alternatives (1, 2, 4 months of paid leave)
- 2. List all affected stakeholders
  - Status quo -> alternative
  - Familiarity bias (close to us in social) 
  - Parents, Future Employees, Current Employees, Shareholder 
  - New Parents (Benefit) great, No children (Harm) make up work, 
- 3. Assess the effects on all stakeholders
  - Data collection
  - Short-term and long-term consequences
  - Predict the future (always uncertain)
  - Stakeholder groups (# of people affected) + (Amount each person affected) + Marginal Utility ($1 less well-off > $1 more well-off) 
  - Example
    - New Parents (benefit) -> more money to be allocated, not as rich
- 4. Sum up net benefits and costs
  - Better than status quo
  - Overall best sum
  - Example
    - Vulnerable population at firms
    - Parental leave policies (succeed) and recruit talented
    - Best for firm to offer parental leave
  - Consequentialist is difficult
- 5. Set up general set of rules
  - Policy against bribery
  - Bribery (ensure)
  - Medical Needs (Vulnerable population)
  - Bribery negative conseqeuences (hinder economic development and foster corruption)
  - best consequences
- 6. When to use in-depth consequentialism vs general set of rules
  - General set of rulese (routine decisions)
  - Hit high-stakes decision (do it from scratch)
- Many of us use consequentialist reasoning. Lots of complex steps, more carefully and rigorously

### Objections to Consequentialism
- Assessing how an action affects various stakeholders, weighing the benefits and harms before choosing a course of action
- Consequentialism has been subject to many other objection
- Objection #0: "Nobody makes decisions this way." (Nobody routinely sets up spreadsheets) 
  - leaders constantly justify company's decisions by talking about positive effects will have on certain groups of stakeholders
  - Coworkers - controversial policy aligned with company's values (without benefits) 
- challenge is: if we talk like consequentialists, we need to take consequetialist reasoning seriously
  - Rather than simply finding a few positive effects of our actions, in order to justify whatever we want to do, 
  - think broadly about all of the consequences of our actions
- Three Objections to Consequentialist Reasoning
  - Objection #1: Doesn't always respect individual rights
    - Ex. Is it okay for companies to gather information on prospective employees?
    - Strong consequentialist arguments that it is okay and appropriate for them to do this
    - Ex. avoid hiring people whose backgrounds indicate their backgrounds would be ill-suited for particular roles
    - Reasonable objection: individuals have a right to privacy. Except for extreme cases, wrong to dig into a person's personal life.
  - Objection #2: Difficult to measure individuals' well-being or happiness (utility)
    - Long-standing debate among consequentialist philosophers about whether people accurately judge their own well-being
    - Ex. smoking - normally whene someone buys a product, reasonable assume will make them off (cigarettes) 
    - No, smoking makes smoker worse off
    - Paternalistically come to our own judgement about what best serves other people's interests (deep question)
    - Any product that potentially harms consumer (especially if consumers are not aware)
  - Objection #3: Difficulty of measurement
    - Often the effects of a company policy can be very difficult to assess
    - Ex. Consider a deal with a principal, buying new computers (bribing) 
    - Principal (would), Company, Students (Future bribes -), (Increase corruption -_
    - Problem: from psychology, people have a strong tendency to misperceive things in ways that happen to align with their own interests.
    - Ex. student overestimated how getting computer from her company vs other
    - Self-serving conclusion her bribe no effect on the future behavior of the principal or on others in society
- Similarly, consequentialist reasoning often is subject to self-serving biases, in the sense that we tend to overestimate how much our preferred action benefits our workers, shareholders, or consumers while underestimating the harms that it causes
 
### Practical Applications of Consequentialism
- How can consequentialist analysis be applied to concrete business decisions?
- Easiest way is to make a quick story on how we are "making the world a better place"
- To do it more seriously, carefully consider all of the effects of our actions
- Example #1 Sweatshops
  - Low-paid workers 
  - Often young girls who work rather than go to school
  - Factories are full of health hazard and prone to collapse or major fires
  - People in wealthy have a natural moral intuition about this
  - Factory conditions are applaing and the clothing companies should shut down all sweatshops 
  - Only produce clothes in countries with higher wages and good working conditions
  - Think about the effect of such decision ***
    - Effects on the peoplle that it is supposed to benefit
    - Many of the workers in sweatshops work there precisely because the job is better, often substantially better, than other alternatives
    - Strong consequentialist argument for continuing to produce clothing in sweatshops
  - On the other hand, consequentialist analysis should consider
    - Possibility clothing companies could increase the wages somewhat for garment workers in develeoping countries
    - Factory operators adhere to somewhat better health and safety standards
    - Raise price of clothing a bit
    - Reduce profits for the clothing companies and the factory operators
    - Benefits to the workers would be substantial and probably outweigh these downsides
 - Example #2 Designing addictive video games or social media platforms
  - Many online experiences are carefully crafted to maximize engagement
  - Getting users to spend as much time as possible on a game or a website
  - Games for freemium model, the gamers can play for free but buy-in
  - Engagement converts into advertisement revenue 
  - As wonderful as the two can be, strong argument that spending countless hours isn't good for individuals, families, neighbors, and society. Responsibility to be less addictive (Harm > Benefits) 
- Example #3 D2C of Pharmaceuticals
  - Advertisements of all kind of prescriptive drugs (TV, magazine, subway)
  - Drugs (allergies, bipolar, pain, smoking, medical conditions)
  - A major criticism is it induces people to pressure their doctors to prescribe drugs they don't really need (costs)
    - Costly for healthcare payer
    - Substantial health side effects
  - Benefits
    - Suffer significant medical conditions
    - Learn information and treatment
  - Consequentialist Analysis (drug for each patient) minimal side effects, raise awareness previously untreated
  - Systematic Consequentialist Analysis would also consider the cost to healthcare providers and insurers, benefits to the pharmaceutical companies, and impact on people around the world
  - Systematic Consequentialist Analysis powerful tool for analysis for business decisions. Better place, actually assess consequences of their actions

### Consequentialist Stakeholder Analysis
- 1. Status Quo vs Alternative
- 2. List stakeholders -> consequences of alternative -> Net benefits (++/+/0/-/--)
- 3. Summary

### Al-Shabaab Consequentialist Stakeholder analysis
- Net benefit is close to 0, however more clarity on what to research on the indirect consequences
