Notes on Empathy, Listening, Leadership, Business, Case Studies, Decision Making

One key goal of leadership: energize and equip others to achieve exceptional results that exceed established goals.
- "To be heard, first we must listen."
- "The sheer act of listening speaks volumes that even a great speech can't communicate."
- "The wise man doesn't give the right answers, he poses the right questions."
- "It is only as we develop oothers that we permanently succeed."

### Tactical Focuses
Sharpen the fundamentals and greatly improve the following abilities:
1. Listen with purpose, focus, and curiousity
2. Encourage and inspire others through genuinely acknowledging them.
3. Ask more on-target and powerful questions
4. Require others to develop their own solutions and action plans
5. Delegate with greater wisdom and thoughtfulness
6. Develop a culture of consistent accountability

Being intentional about respecting those you work with - motivated to listen to them, to ask them what they thought, to delegate more effectively, and to hold them accountable rather than doing things himsellf or just giving them a pass.

Outcome: become a great listener and questioner, one who can inspire others, bring out their sharpest thinking, delegate with new purpose in mind, and consistently hold them accountable.
