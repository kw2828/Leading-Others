# Empathy and Listening

Empathy and listening to ourselves and others. Explore nonverbal aspect.
"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you madde them feel."

### A few principles: 
1. Listening is a practice of doing less not more
2. Empathy is an action that can be communicated non-verbally
3. Empathy and listening when practiced together can become one thing. 
4. Both can be rather effortless and come naturally when we llet them

- Much is communicated non-verbally (shallowness of breath, way I show up, body language, tone)
- Screens and adjusting: real-time adjustments (holding our body, breath, what we're doing)
- Empathy - tonal voice, facial expression, quality of the listening. 
- When practiced together, becomes the same. When we're listening, empathy is not very far away
- When both are practiced together. Seamlessly become one thing (idea is wisdom is inherent, opening a path to emerge, empathy is inherent in us. Something we can sharpen, inherent in us, clear a path for it. Create conditions to thrive, naturally and comfortably to thrive)

### The Art of the Right Question (The words + timing + tone) best tool (Persuasion/Influence)
Artfully create questions at the right time, right pace, non-verbally, and deliver in such a way that provokes the receiver curiousity, excitment, positive response, potential.

1. How would you describe the feeling in the body when you are in flow?
2. What does it feel like in your body when you're in a powerful creative state? What is your mindset like?
3. How do you feel when you focus easily and confidently? 
4. How do you feel when you can focus easily and confidently? 
5. What's the best that has happened to you this week? 

Empathy is a natural force, empathy moves around us like light. Coming back to ourselves. How are we talking to ourselves is very important. Coming on more and more in the 1:1 sessions. "The voice in our head is the most powerful one." What kind of questions would you ask yourself. 

### A few more questions to relect (your mirrror neurons) on
1. How does empathy feel in my body? How does it feel when someone is empathetic towards me?
2. How do I define 'Empathy' now? How much is too much? How much is too little? 
3. What does it take to be empathetic? Does it feel transactional? Can that be subtracted?
4. Do I need to think to be empathetic, or can I let my intuition guide me? Is empathy an intellectual exercise?

Empathy is not an intellectual exercise, don't think too much. Take a deep breath. Breath is the first anchor to being present. Useful to think about it, but once it's thought of, matter of doing and behavior. 

### Neuroactivity of Empathy and Self-Activating Neuroplasticity
1. Activity note just in the brain but the rest of the body. Neurological decision makers (head, heart, gut). Production of neurons throughout the nervous system, emotional center in the heart, trust in the gut. Man we can do anything when they're aligned (head, heart, core). 
2. Empathy as a habit (learning and great repetition). Repetition is the keystone of learning. Gentle check-in to notice what we're doing lots of, pushed into these new habits, temporary, noticing checking in on (3-4 days) not get into long routine of. 
3. Practice empathy. Becomes learned behavior. Easily activated. Do ourselves a favor.

### Listening is a path to quiet mind 
1. "Listening is not understanding the words in the question asked, listening is understanding why the question was asked" - Simon Sinek. Empathy and listening primal human forces communicated non-verbally.
2. Meditation is challenging. Not for everyone, no big deal. Approaching the baggage of meditation, few moments. client found it very challenging. Suggested, why don't you just sit down eyes closed, doesn't need to be fancy, relatively easily. Permission to "meditate", "intentional quite", and "listening around", checking pre-existing sound. Doesn't require an effort, helps quiet the mind. 
3. "Being heard is so close to being loved that for the average person, they are almost indistinguisable." Rare to give someone full attention. Listening is a path to a quiet mind.

### Exercise - Listen
1. Listen to yourself
2. Listen to sounds around
3. Listen as neutral observation around you
4. Listening as a path to a quiet mind.
5. No need to create a perfect and peaceful environment (5-7 minutes)

### Color Wheel: a self-hyponsis tool for a quick relief (Anti-anxiety relief/stress) - First exercise to kids
1. Start with a deep cleansing breath 
2. Take another
3. Take another and exhaling all air from the lungs
4. Just continuing by letting breathing be easy and natural. Attention rest. Listen to the sounds to my voice, on this call, around you. Listening to everything as one sound. Imagine a wave of relaxation over your body, cascading over your head, cheeks, necks, shoulders, arms, hand, spine, core, hips, down both land, to feet. Body grounded, deep breath, exhaled twice as long.
5. Privacy of your own mind. Non-verbal experience of this moment, imagine to let your mind think about what it doesn't have to think about. Noticing and reflecting all the good things that happened this week that wouldn't happen otherwise. Any changes for the past week or two. Starting with yourself. Sense of compassion, observing any feelings. Starting with yourself and people around you. checking in with your body. Asking the question to your own higher mind. Notice any feelings from earlier today? Any feelings you don't need. Noticing where you feeling. Asking question to higher mind? If this feeling was a color what would it be?


Color wheel: (very imaginative, work with kids, wonderful with kids, very simple and playful, 10-20x teaching me) - Emotional Intelligence tool, everybody doing it. Wonderful for adults, athletes, clearing unnecessary stress/nerves
1. Notice any feeling in the body that you don't need.
2. Ask "if that feeling were a color, what color would it be?"
3. Ask "What color would feel better?"
4. Imaging the second color flooding that area of the body where the old color had been - seeing and feeling it move through. (Enjoy and play with your imagination here)
5. Checking in, does it feel different now? How so? Repeat if necessary or desired. 

### Conclusions (The end has no end): 
- Empathy + Listening
- Listening is a practice of doing less not more.
- Substraction is talked about all the time (color wheel trick), suggesting to do less, subtract noise in body and attention. Pathway to so many things, meditation, sensuous practice to do
- Empathy and listening when practice together can become one thing
- Both can be rather effortless and come naturally when they let them.

### Tactics:
- Use your breath, The Color Wheel, and active listening to change your states and relive stress
- Use creative, leading questions as quick and helpful interrupts
- Screens are trance-inducing substances. Give yourself breaks. Consider resting your eyes and your brain with meditation (active meditation, music/cooking/running anything can be meditatitve) - giving yourselves rest to restore energy.
- If meditation feels challenging, consider yourself a few moments of intentional quiet by sitting in a chair with your closed and taking a few deep breaths.
- Senses in the moment - Placing attention into their body language, breath, tonal, - active externalize my attention. More flowing and intuitive. Catch myself own opinion. take myself on them. Beautiful principle with work "Our work, whatever vocation, more important than our ideas about the work." Staying more committed to the conversations, don't be caught up with my opinion. 
- Validation/Recognition - Therapeutic context, business context, - context is crucial. When we don't validate, negotiation tactic, what it means to not validate. primal we seek validation, inherent and empathetic. crucial how we engage and play with it as we're operating together. 
- Showing too much empathy: extreme of a hypothetical, sacrifice too much of myself for others; borrow money, so much can't pay for rent, creating danger, empathy. Naunce, too much of our attention, so many degrees and spectrum and context matter. check ourselves and boundary are. How empathetic we should be, sacrificing ourselves. 
- Suggestion: how to balance? Moving target, very few final destinations, few essentials, remaining both flexible to our boundaries. How much empathy is appropriate, final measure. Defer as you're expert on yourselves. Listen to your body taken advantage of, imbalance in scales of justice (injustice) something out of measure. Suggestion is to listen yourself with awareness of boundaries, notice discomfort. 
- Other than taking a deep breath to be anchored in the moment, what are some other tactical techniques to practice empathy, especially during conversations?
