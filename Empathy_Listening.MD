### Empathy and Listening

Empathy and listening to ourselves and others. Explore nonverbal aspect.
"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you madde them feel."

A few principles: 
1. Listening is a practice of doing less not more
2. Empathy is an action that can be communicated non-verbally
3. Empathy and listening when practiced together can become one thing. 
4. Both can be rather effortless and come naturally when we llet them

- Much is communicated non-verbally (shallowness of breath, way I show up, body language, tone)
- Screens and adjusting: real-time adjustments (holding our body, breath, what we're doing)
- Empathy - tonal voice, facial expression, quality of the listening. 
- When practiced together, becomes the same. When we're listening, empathy is not very far away
- When both are practiced together. Seamlessly become one thing (idea is wisdom is inherent, opening a path to emerge, empathy is inherent in us. Something we can sharpen, inherent in us, clear a path for it. Create conditions to thrive, naturally and comfortably to thrive)
