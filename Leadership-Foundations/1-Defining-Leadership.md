# Defining Leadership

Leadership is a broad topic. Leadership framework contains three things:

1. Definition
2. Competencies
3. Values

Leadership: motivating and inspiring a group of individuals to achieve a shared goal

To successfully achieve this shared goal, you need five basic competencies: develop self awareness, the ability to understand the perspectives of others, understanding situational context, the ability to communicate effectively, and the ability to use data to make effective decisions.

Four core values: humility, curiosity, compassion, and courage

“My status is inferior to yours at this moment because you know something or can do something that Ineed in order to accomplish some task or goal... I have to be humble because I am temporarilydependent on you. [But] I also have a choice. I can either not commit to tasks that make medependent on others, or I can deny the dependency, avoid feeling humble, fail to get what I need,and, thereby, fail to accomplish the task or unwittingly sabotage it. Unfortunately people oftenwould rather fail than to admit their dependence on someone else.”

We live in a world where ego gets attention but modesty gets results. Where arrogance makes headlines but humility makes a difference. Which means that all of us, as leaders or aspiring leaders,face questions of our own: Are we confident enough to stay humble? Are we strong enough to admitwe don’t have all the answers? Here’s hoping we reach the right answers.
