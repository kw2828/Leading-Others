### Trust as a Business Principle

The 10 Laws of Trust - Building the bonds that make a business great
- Trust is elemental. We all cherish it. Most of us think we deserve it. Few of us think we violate it.
  - What is trust?
  - Trust means willingly ceding a measure of control to another - be it a person, organization, or institution - and without the apparent safety nets of a binding contract or other means of coercion in place.
  - Although we trust with an expectation that others will respond in kind, vulnerability is the psychological hallmark of trust
  - We're taking a risk, sometimes based on limited evidence
  - Trust is a leap of faith rooted in optimism
- We take trust for granted (not conscious of how it prevades relationships)
  - Partners rely on partners, employers on employees, companies on each other
  - Nations on other nations, families on other family members
  - P2P Economy - individuals sharing cars, boats, apartments trust is all the more indispensable

  - Takes initiation, nurture, evaluation and repair
  - Trust is earned
  - Trust builds over time, fostered not only by decency but also by enlightened self-interest
  - Trust works to everyone's benefit
  - Trust accelerates decision-making
  - Trust is neither an end unto itself nor merely a technique for achieving a desired outcome
  - Trust is the operating system for a life well lived 
- There is power in being trustworthy
  - In the economy of trust, what goes around comes around
  - The more we look out for otthers, tthe more they look out for us
  - The more we trustt, the more we are trusted

  - No Asshole Rule
  - How untrusting workplace would productivity and morale

- 10 Laws of Trust
  - Lays out attitudes and behaviors you can count on to increase the odds that the flow of trust will not be interrupted
  - Being smart about whom to trust, when to trust, and how to nurture organizational trust is key to implementing the 10 Laws
  - Following truths about the very nature of trust (preconditions, varities, underpinnings and risks) prepares a leader to undertake the job of building a high-trust organization
 
 1. Trust - well-ground depends on three conditions
 - To safely and reliably allow others to act on our behalf (trusting them) we must count on three underpinnings: 
    - Character: means that those we trust will value our interests as their own
    - Competence: means that those we trust have the requisite intelligence, ability, and training to achieve our best interests
    - Authority: means that those we trust are empowered to deliver on promises
 - When all three conditions are present, trust develops naturally
    - but when any of the three is absent, trust must take a holiday
    - to trust in the absence of any of these three elements is not smart but naive - eventuall betrayal
    - those who meet all three conditions (character + competence + authority), almost always possess a broader view of life's purpose than merely securing the best personal outcome in every single transaction, conversation, negotiation
    - Long-term trust (marathon
 2. Three types of trust
  - The three forms
    - Reciprocal
    - Representative
    - Pseudo-Trust
  - Reciprocal (or mutual) trust exists when people advance each other's interests out of love, duty, or enlightened self-interest
    - Spouses and family members
    - Mutual trust can also bee found between business partners
    - Shared goals are achieved faster and more durably than when everyone is on his own - mistrustful colleagues, wary of leaders
    - No single runner will beat a 4x100 relay team
  - Representative trust is the more common of reliance
    - Hiring a Lawyer 
    - Young children trust parents to represent them
    - Doctors and other professional
    - Nobody can be an expert at everything, we must trust professionals to represent our interests faithfully
  - Pseudo-Trust
    - Temporary alignment of one's self-interests with those of another
    - Many contractual economic relationships (not the real thing)
    - Undermine efforts to build a high-trust culture of collaboration
    - Mafia dons (mutual dependence on fear and greed)
    - Pseudo-Trust Arrangement (enemy of my enmy is my friend) 
 3. Underlying motivators establish potential trust levels
  - Different levels of trust exist in different kinds of organization
  - No-trust organizations (prisons) rely on force
  - Low-trust organizations (dictatorship) live on fear
  - Motivator in most business organizations is reward
  - High-trust organizations are motivated by duty and love
    - by a sense of meaning and mission
    - calling
  - Bonds between parent and child (yield this sort of trust within a family) 
  - Trust level by organization
    - Force - Prisons, Asylum (low trust, low motivators)
    - Fear (Dictatorships, Labor Unions, Government)
    - Reward (Schools, Businesses)
    - Duty (Mility, Foundations, Churches)
    - Love (Families)
  - High-trust end of the spectrum
    - Leaders = trust levels are not fixed by the nature of the organization
    - As a leader you can move the needle
    - Goal of any leader should be to move to the high-trust end of the spectrum
    - Reliance on mission, caring, meaning, and duty
 4. As trust declines, people grab power
  - Role of power in achieving desired ends in contrasting low-trust and high-trust organizations
  - "It's all about ME", "It's all about the mission"
  - "To get stuff: money, health, needs"; "To achieve common goals consistent with values"
  - Trust (Knowledge, Competence, Judgement, Hard Work, Fidicuiary Behavior)
  - Power flows to those who break rules, make credible threats, self-promote, technique to coerce others
  - Durable power derives from trust "Power without trust seems like a hollow victory for a leader and a thin platform from which to lead."
 5. Trust risks betrayal
  - Trust mutual agreement, occasionally end in betrayal
  - Betrayal requires the existence of trust in the first place
  - All three forms of trust are subject to potential betrayal
  - Pseudo-Trust by its very nature
  - Reciprocal & Representative trust: extent you've trusted someone without Character, Competence, Authority
  - Betrayal (never to be rebuilt)
    - Potential of betrayal can be minimized by:
      - making sure all elements of trust are well established (character, competence, authority)
      - Understanding the three forms that trust take (reciprocal, representative, and pseudo) and pseudo only matter of time
      - Culture rooted in 10 Laws o Trust
  - Absence of trust is betrayal - everyone condemned to work for coercive leaders
